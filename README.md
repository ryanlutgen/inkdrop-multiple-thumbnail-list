> Inkdrop plugin to show multiple thumbnail images and alter modified date format in note lists


![](./images/screenshot.PNG)

This plugin, forked from [Fus1onDev/inkdrop-thumbnail-list](https://github.com/Fus1onDev/inkdrop-thumbnail-list) under the MIT license, was designed to show multiple images in the thumbnail preview, and alter the modified date format.

This plugin was written to make note lists appear like another, Apple device exclusive notetaking app, which shall remain unnamed.

Important things to note between this plugin and repo it is forked from ([Fus1onDev/inkdrop-thumbnail-list](https://github.com/Fus1onDev/inkdrop-thumbnail-list))

1. The config options were removed.  Reason being is that this plugin was written with a specific look in mind.

## Install

```sh
ipm install multiple-thumbnail-list-and-short-date
```

## Usage

- Upon installing, the app might crash with an error regarding dayJS.  If this happens, please exit Inkdrop and restart.
